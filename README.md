### **Description**

A user friendly Reading List application with the implementation of React. A user can create a list with the books they would like to read by adding the tittle of the book, the author and a synopsis. This then creates a list with all the information entered by the user. Once the user has finished reading the book they then have the option to delete the book from their list. A very fun, convenient and practical application
